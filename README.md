# NUSH_Hack_24-GaitAnalysis
A project created for NUSH Hack 2024! Recognises someone's gait and walking/running pattern in order to automatically open a gate rather than having to take out your access card / stare into a webcam for facial recognition. Useful for situtations such as your hands being full of stuff, forgetting your access card at home or being in a hurry!
